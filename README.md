# Java Subject Project

## Overview

This proj*ect is a Java application designed to demonstrate the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Data Structures, and Algorithms. It includes a functional user interface built with Java Swing. The project implements efficient data storage and retrieval techniques by saving data to a text file, which is loaded when the program starts.*

## *Features*

1. ***Object-Oriented Design****: Classes and objects are utilized to model real-world entities and ensure code modularity.*
2. ***Data Structures****: Efficient data storage and manipulation are achieved using suitable data structures (e.g., Arrays, Lists, Maps, or Trees).*
3. ***Algorithms****: Algorithms are applied to process and organize data effectively.*
4. ***File Handling****: Persistent data storage by writing to and reading from a **`.txt`** file.*
5. ***User Interface****: A graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented using Java Swing, providing an interactive user experience.*

## *How It Works*

1. ***Data Storage****:*
   - *Data entered by the user is stored in appropriate data structures.*
   - *When the application closes, the data is serialized and written to **`txt`**.*
2. ***Data Retrieval****:*
   - *When the application starts, it reads **`data.txt`**, deserializes the data, and populates the relevant data structures.*
3. ***UI Interaction****:*
   - *Users interact with the application via the GUI, which is designed using Java Swing.*
   - *The interface allows data input, updates, and visualization.*
